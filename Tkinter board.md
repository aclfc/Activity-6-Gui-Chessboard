####Watch lesson videos 10 and 11 before attempting this activity.
1. Create a tkinter window called root.
2. Add a canvas widget called board that is 900x900 with a light background. Place the canvas in root using the grid 
geometry manager.
3. Create an 800x800 chessboard inside of the board canvas using 100x100 squares. You will use the canvas.create_rectangle tool to do this. Give each rectangle an appropriate background. 
4. Use canvas.create_text to place chess pieces on the board using FEN notation. Each piece should be tagged so that it 
can be moved later on.
